# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. We were asked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

## Results: 
Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. 
Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.



## Summary: 
Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. 
If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
